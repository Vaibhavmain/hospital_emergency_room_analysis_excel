Overview

This project analyzes hospital ER data using Excel to understand patient volume and service efficiency. The dashboard shows real patterns like peak hours, wait times, and admission rates so hospital managers can make better decisions.

    How long patients wait before seeing a doctor
    Which departments handle the most cases
    Admission patterns and patient demographics

Tools and Technologies
